# Riskified Fraud Detection Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce transaction data to identify **patterns in fraud (chargebacks)** and **optimize the approval threshold** for online orders. The analysis was designed to simulate a fraud detection use case similar to how **Riskified** might approach approval decisions for digital and tangible products.

---

##  Objective

- Find the **optimal classification threshold** that approves 90% of orders while minimizing chargebacks.
- Compare the fraud behavior across **digital vs. tangible goods**.
- Explore key patterns in **customer behavior, order value, and account age** that influence chargeback likelihood.
- Recommend data-driven actions for fraud prevention and approval logic.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** ‚Äì Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** ‚Äì Visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** ‚Äì Interactive EDA

## Key Insights

- ‚úÖ A **threshold score** was identified to approve 90% of orders safely.
- üìâ **Customer Account Age** is negatively correlated with chargeback risk ‚Äî newer accounts are riskier.
- üí∞ Almost all charged-back orders are concentrated below a certain **order_price** (~‚Çπ1500).
- üßæ **Digital goods** have different fraud patterns than tangible ones, with generally higher chargeback ratios.

## Sample Visual Analysis

- Distribution plots comparing **approved vs. chargeback orders**
- Count plots for **product type vs. fraud**
- Trendlines showing how fraud correlates with **order price and customer age**

---

## Dataset

- A sample dataset (`Technical Interview Dataset.xlsx`) was used with anonymized fields such as:
  - `order_price`
  - `classification_score`
  - `product_type`
  - `customer_account_age`
  - `label` (approved/chargeback)

---

## Outcome

The project resulted in a **threshold-based logic** that could help a fraud detection engine improve its **approval accuracy** while minimizing business losses due to chargebacks. It also recommended **fee adjustments** or stricter screening for:
- Orders from **new customers**
- Orders below a **price threshold**
- Certain **product categories (digital)**
